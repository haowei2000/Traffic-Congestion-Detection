train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'T'.
Provided train_data has 413 rows (NaN fraction=25.9%), 4 time series. Median time series length is 118 (min=49, max=128). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'overall_congestion'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['count_all_0', 'new_count_all_0', 'removed_count_all_0', 'q_all_0', 'k_all_0', 'v_all_0', ...]
	static_features:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['restaurant', 'caffe', 'service', 'landscape']

AutoGluon will ignore following non-numeric/non-informative columns:
	ignored covariates:      ['count_bus_0', 'count_bus_1', 'count_bus_2', 'count_bus_3', 'count_car_0', 'count_car_1', 'count_car_2', 'count_car_3', 'count_truck_0', 'count_truck_1', 'count_truck_2', 'count_truck_3', 'k_bus_0', 'k_bus_1', 'k_bus_2', 'k_bus_3', 'k_car_0', 'k_car_1', 'k_car_2', 'k_car_3', 'k_truck_0', 'k_truck_1', 'k_truck_2', 'k_truck_3', 'new_count_bus_0', 'new_count_bus_1', 'new_count_bus_2', 'new_count_bus_3', 'new_count_car_0', 'new_count_car_1', 'new_count_car_2', 'new_count_car_3', 'new_count_truck_0', 'new_count_truck_1', 'new_count_truck_2', 'new_count_truck_3', 'q_bus_0', 'q_bus_1', 'q_bus_2', 'q_bus_3', 'q_car_0', 'q_car_1', 'q_car_2', 'q_car_3', 'q_truck_0', 'q_truck_1', 'q_truck_2', 'q_truck_3', 'removed_count_bus_0', 'removed_count_bus_1', 'removed_count_bus_2', 'removed_count_bus_3', 'removed_count_car_0', 'removed_count_car_1', 'removed_count_car_2', 'removed_count_car_3', 'removed_count_truck_0', 'removed_count_truck_1', 'removed_count_truck_2', 'removed_count_truck_3', 'v_bus_0', 'v_bus_1', 'v_bus_2', 'v_bus_3', 'v_car_0', 'v_car_1', 'v_car_2', 'v_car_3', 'v_truck_0', 'v_truck_1', 'v_truck_2', 'v_truck_3']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
